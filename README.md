##  Mission Statement

> *"Healthcare + AI is not the future. It's the present."*

I bridge the gap between clinical reality and cutting-edge AI technology. With hands-on nursing experience and deep expertise in computer vision, I don't just build demos — I create **deployable, production-grade ML systems** that solve real healthcare problems.
